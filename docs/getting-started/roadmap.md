# Roadmap

The roadmap tracks the status of components and features that are planned for development.

## Versioning

Shoelace follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Breaking changes in components with the <sl-badge type="primary" pill>Stable</sl-badge> badge will not be accepted until the next major version. As such, all contributions must consider the project's roadmap and take this into consideration. Features that are deemed no longer necessary will be deprecated but not removed.

Components with the <sl-badge type="warning" pill>Experimental</sl-badge> badge should not be used in production. They are made available as release candidates for development and testing purposes. As such, changes to experimental components will not be subject to semantic versioning.

## Changelog

The changelog is available in the project's source in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

You can [view the most recent changelog](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/blob/next/CHANGELOG.md) on GitHub.
