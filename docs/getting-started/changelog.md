# Changelog

Shoelace follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Breaking changes in components with the <sl-badge type="primary" pill>Stable</sl-badge> badge will not be accepted until the next major version. As such, all contributions must consider the project's roadmap and take this into consideration. Features that are deemed no longer necessary will be deprecated but not removed.

Components with the <sl-badge type="warning" pill>Experimental</sl-badge> badge should not be used in production. They are made available as release candidates for development and testing purposes. As such, changes to experimental components will not be subject to semantic versioning.

_During the beta period, these restrictions may be relaxed in the event of a mission-critical bug._ üêõ

### Why did event names change?

Shoelace events were updated to use a lowercase, kebab-style naming convention. Instead of event names such as `slChange` and `slAfterShow`, you'll need to use `sl-change` and `sl-after-show` now.

This change was necessary to address a critical issue in frameworks that use DOM templates with declarative event bindings such as `<sl-button @slChange="handler">`. Due to HTML's case-insensitivity, browsers translate attribute names to lowercase, turning `@slChange` into `@slchange`, making it impossible to listen to `slChange`.

While declarative event binding is a non-standard feature, not supporting it would make Shoelace much harder to use in popular frameworks. To accommodate those users and provide a better developer experience, we decided to change the naming convention while Shoelace is still in beta.

The following pages demonstrate why this change was necessary.
