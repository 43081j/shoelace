## Shadow DOM

Most Shoelace components use Shadow DOM with the exception of form controls. This is for your convenience, since form controls inside a shadow DOM aren't submitted with standard HTML forms. In the future, when StencilJS and browsers add support for [Form-associated Custom Elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements-face-example), it would be nice if all components can use Shadow DOM.

## Attribution

- Theme colors and form controls inspired by [Element](element.eleme.io)
