# ðŸ‘Ÿ Shoelace.css

A back to the basics CSS starter kit. For when you donâ€™t need the whole boot.

---

Shoelace is a starter kit, not a framework. Think of it as a CSS reset sprinkled with helpful components. Bootstrap users will find it familiar, yet refreshing.

Just link to the stylesheet, add your customizations, and start building stuff.

Shoelace is highly customizable through CSS variables. It doesnâ€™t require Less, Sass, or any preprocessing at all. The minified version is only 31KB (6KB gzipped).
